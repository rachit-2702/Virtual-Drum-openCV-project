# Virtual-Drum-openCV-project
I tried creating a virtual drum set, where various instruments can be played by detecting a certain color(here blue) inside a certain region of the camera frame
### Working
Suppose we bring a blue colored stick in the region that has a snare drum image as watermark, then we'll here a snare drum beat
various instruments can be added
